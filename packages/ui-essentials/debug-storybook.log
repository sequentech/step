Storybook has found potential blockers that need to be resolved before upgrading:

Major Version Gap Detected

Your Storybook version (v8.6.12) is more than one major version behind the target release (v10.0.6). Please upgrade one major version at a time.

You can upgrade to version 9 by running:
npx storybook@9 upgrade

Affected projects: /packages/ui-essentials/.storybook

More information: https://storybook.js.org/docs/9/migration-guide?ref=upgrade

After addressing this, you can try running the upgrade command again. You can also rerun the upgrade command with the --force flag to skip the blocker check and to proceed with the upgrade.
