# janitor

Janitor is an conversion tool. It converts a sql dump and an excel file
into an election event configuration that can be imported through the
admin-portal.
 
## Installation

### Offline (Windows)

First follow the instructions to install and configure the Sequent Step 
Platform.

Then, Open the Windows PowerShell and navigate to the `packages` folder. Once
there, install Python and Pip with the following command:

```bash
wsl sudo dpkg -i *.deb
```

Then you can install the pip project dependencies with:

```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links=python_packages -r requirements.txt
```

### Online

Before using it, you need python3 and pip. In Ubuntu, you can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip
```

If you're in a codespace, you need to install and configure virtualenv:

```bash
pip install --user virtualenvwrapper
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
export WORKON_HOME=~/.virtualenvs
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=$(which python3)
source $(find /nix/store/ -name "virtualenvwrapper.sh" | grep python3)
source ~/.bashrc
mkvirtualenv janitor
workon janitor
```

Then you need to install the packages the script uses:

```bash
cd /workspaces/step/packages/windmill/external-bin/janitor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

You'll need to add the COMELEC keycloak template. Upload it to 
`janitor/templates/COMELEC/keycloak.hbs`

## Use

The script has two inputs, a postgres dump file (.sql), and an excel (.xls) file.
You can use the example files hereby included:

```bash
cd janitor
python3 ./run.py ./import-data/ovcs_ver7.sql ./import-data/29-09-2024-event-import.xlsx
```

The output files are:
- `output/election_config.json`. This is the election event json that you
	can import in the admin portal.
- `logs/process_log.log`. Logs generated by the tool.
  
The tool also prints some output to provide feedback on the process.

## tenant configuration

You can change the tenant id in the file `janitor/config/baseConfig.json`.
