# SimpleSAMLphp IdP Reference Implementation

## Purpose

This directory contains a **reference implementation** of a SAML 2.0 Identity Provider (IdP) using SimpleSAMLphp. It serves two purposes:

1. **For Sequent Developers:** Provides a local test IdP for developing and testing the Keycloak SP/broker integration
2. **For Third-Party Integrators:** Demonstrates best practices for implementing IdP-initiated SSO with Sequent's voting platform

## Important Notes

- **This is NOT a production deployment of SimpleSAMLphp for Sequent**
- **Third-party organizations will deploy their own IdP** (which may or may not use SimpleSAMLphp)
- This implementation shows the **pattern** and **configuration approach** that third-parties should follow

### Integration Documentation

**For detailed integration instructions, see:**

📖 [IdP-Initiated SSO Integration Guide](../../docs/docusaurus/docs/integrations/idp_initiated_sso_integration_guide.md)

This guide includes:
- Complete integration steps
- Production deployment checklist
- Security considerations
- Troubleshooting guide
- Code examples for various platforms

## Security Notes

### Certificate Management

- **Development:** Run `.devcontainer/scripts/initialize-command.sh` from the repository root before building. It generates a fresh local key/certificate pair in `cert/`, excluded from Git, and preserves an existing pair on subsequent starts. Reimport the new public certificate in local Keycloak when renewing the pair. See [local certificates](../certs/README.md).
- **Production:** Third-parties must use valid certificates from a trusted CA
- **Never commit private keys** to version control

### HTTPS Requirements

- **Development:** HTTP acceptable for localhost testing
- **Production:** HTTPS is **mandatory** for all endpoints

### SAML Signing

- All SAML responses/assertions must be signed
- Use RSA-SHA256 or stronger signing algorithms
- Validate signatures on both IdP and SP sides

## About This Implementation

This SimpleSAMLphp setup is **not** part of Sequent's production infrastructure. It exists solely as a reference and testing tool. In production deployments:

- **Third-party organizations** run their own IdP using their chosen platform
- **Sequent** operates the Service Provider (authentication service) side only
- This reference implementation demonstrates the **patterns and configuration** that third-parties should replicate in their own IdP

The value of this implementation is showing **how** to structure configuration, **how** to build metadata, and **how** the SSO flow works - not providing a ready-made production solution.
