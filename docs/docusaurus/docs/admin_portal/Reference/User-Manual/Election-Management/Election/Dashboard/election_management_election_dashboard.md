# Dashboard

The Dashboard provides administrators with a snapshot of an individual Election’s progress and key statistics. Note that this displays a subset of data specific to the selected Election (not the broader Election Event).

## Metrics
- **Eligible Voters**  
  Displays the total number of voters eligible to participate in this Election.

- **Actual Voters (Enrolled Voters)**  
  Shows the count of enabled/enrolled voters who can cast a ballot in this Election.

- **Areas**  
  Indicates the number of geographic or organizational areas assigned to this Election.

- **Emails Sent**  
  Total number of email notifications sent to voters for this Election.

- **SMS Sent**  
  Total number of SMS notifications sent to voters for this Election.

## Charts
- **Votes by Day**  
  A time-series chart illustrating daily voting activity (number of ballots cast per day) for this Election.

- **Voters by Channel**  
  A pie or donut chart showing the distribution of votes by channel (e.g., Online, Paper, Telephone, Postal) for this Election.

## Notes
- This Dashboard reflects only the data for the specific Election you are viewing.  
- For broader context or aggregated metrics across multiple Elections, refer to the Election Event Dashboard.
- Use these insights to monitor participation trends, identify potential issues early, and guide communications or interventions as needed.
