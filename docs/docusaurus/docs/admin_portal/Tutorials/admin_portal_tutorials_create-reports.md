To generate a report you need to select the Election Event in the Admin Portal 
and add an entry for a specific report type:

1. Go to the tab `REPORTS` and click the button `Create Report` or `ADD`.
2. Select the type (see special notes to consider for specific types below).
3. Optional: Select Election for reporting only an specific election.
4. Optional: Choose a template, for that you must have created one earlier (See [more about 
   creating templates below](/docs/docusaurus/docs/admin_portal/Reference/User-Manual/Templates/admin_portal_reference_user-manual_templates)), if none is selected the system´s default will be used.
5. Save

Then you should be able to see a new report entry on the list.
Click in actions (3 dots on the right side) and do:
- Generate: To create a report based on real data.
- Preview: To generate an example of that report template based on mock data.
