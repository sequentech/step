## Overview

To generate a report, you need to select the Election Event in the Admin Portal and add an entry for a specific report type.

## Creating a Report

1. Go to the **REPORTS** tab and click the **Create Report** or **ADD** button.
2. Select the type (see special notes for specific types below).
3. **Optional:** Select Election for reporting only a specific election.
4. **Optional:** Choose a template. You must have created one earlier (see [more about creating templates](../Reference/User-Manual/Templates/admin_portal_reference_user-manual_templates)). If none is selected, the system's default will be used.
5. Click **Save**.

## Generating Reports

After creating a report entry, you will see it in the list. Click on the actions menu (3 dots on the right side) and choose:

- **Generate:** Create a report based on real data
- **Preview:** Generate an example of that report template based on mock data

## Report Types

### Voters Turnout

**Note:** To display male and female percentages, the sex attribute must have been added. Check out [how to add the sex attribute](admin_portal_tutorials_add-user-attributes-to-keycloak).

### Other Report Types

*Additional report types will be documented here as they become available.*
