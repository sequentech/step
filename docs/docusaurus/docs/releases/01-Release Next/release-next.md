## 🐞 Voter log errors

Username is different for voter logs generated by keycloak and by windmill (one
is the username and the other the email address).

## 🐞 Admin Portal > Sidebar: Can't select active events tab if all Events are archived

If all existing Election Events are archived and you click on the "Active" tab
of the Admin Portal sidebar, it goes back to the Archived tab automatically.

## 🐞 Default Invalid vote policy mismatch

The default Invalid Vote Policy was different in the backend and the front-end.
As a result, the UI displayed the policy as `warn-explicit-and-implicit`, even
though the actual default (when not predefined) was `allowed`.

- Issue: [#8855](https://github.com/sequentech/meta/issues/8855)

## 🐞 Windmill > Can't create Ballot Images on ARM

The correct version of java jvm for the container architecture is installed instead 
of just defaulting to installing x86-x64 version.
