# Tally

## Discarded/Auditable Ballots

Discarded Ballots that for some reason are not included in the tally. Possible reasons:

- The voter was disabled.
- The voter was deleted.
- The ballot was cast outside the Voting Period.
- The voter is not authorized for the election of the ballot.
- The voter is not assigned to the area of the ballot.
- The ballot is from a previous revote (only the last vote counts). (Note, this is not counted as a discarded ballot yet).

## Eligible Voters

Eligible voters are voters that can vote. Voters not included here are disabled and deleted voters.
