## What is Sequent Bulletin Board?

Sequent Bulletin Board is a cryptographically verifiable data store. It is
implemented using Rust and pieces of Google's [trillian].

It's used as the verifiable log of the 2nd generation Sequent Voting Platform,
but also a generic datastore adaptable to other use-cases.
